I'm a fourth year PhD student in Scientific Computing at Uppsala Universitet. I'm interested in the mathematical and computational modelling of cell population behaviour. This includes behaviours such as cell signalling, patterning, etc which we model using both deterministic and stochastic methods. Within our research we are concerned with capturing the the biological behaviour realistically while also using a variety of mathematical and computational tools to analyse and identify model behaviour.
